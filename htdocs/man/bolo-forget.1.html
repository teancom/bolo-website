DESCRIPTION
    bolo is a lightweight monitoring system kernel that aggregates counter
    data and sample readings, maintains event and state information, and
    broadcasts its findings to all connected *bolo subscribers*. These
    subscribers can perform a wide variety of functions, from storing metric
    data in RRDs to sending notifications on state changes.

    bolo forget is a utility that sends controll messages to the bolo core
    to forget matching data patterns.

OPTIONS
    pattern
        A Perl Compatible Regular Expression to match against named
        datapoints. A pattern is always required.

    -t, --type (state|counter|sample|rate|all)
        The type of datapoints to forget, this options can be called
        multiple times. If no option is specified, type defaults to all.
        Where all is state, counter, sample, and rate. Which is everything
        except keys and events.

    -e, --endpoint *tcp://host:port*
        The bolo controller endpoint to connect to. Defaults to
        *tcp:127.0.0.1:2998* Supports DNS resolution for both IPv4 and IPv6
        endpoints.

    -i, --ignore
        For matched datapoints, ignore future submissions that have the
        exact name, that was previously ignored.

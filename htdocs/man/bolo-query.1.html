    bolo query - Bolo Monitoring System Controller

SYNOPSIS
    bolo query [-e tcp://host:port]

DESCRIPTION
    bolo is a lightweight monitoring system kernel that aggregates counter
    data and sample readings, maintains event and state information, and
    broadcasts its findings to all connected *bolo subscribers*. These
    subscribers can perform a wide variety of functions, from storing metric
    data in RRDs to sending notifications on state changes.

    bolo query is a clent that reads commands from standard input, and
    relays them to a bolo aggregator (specified by the -e flag).

    The following commands are understood:

    state STATE-NAME
        Retrieve the current status and summary message of the given state.

    set.keys KEY1 VALUE1 [KEY2 VALUE2 ...]
        Set one or more keys and their values.

    get.keys KEY1 [KEY2 ...]
        Retrieve the value for one or more keys, by name.

    del.keys KEY1 [KEY2 ...]
        Delete the named keys from the bolo keystore.

    search.keys PATTERN
        List out keys that match the given pattern.

    get.events [SINCE]
        Retrieve and print the list of buffered events that occurred on or
        after the given timestamp. If there is no timestamp, all events are
        retrieved.

    dump
        Dump the state data, as YAML.

OPTIONS
    -e, --endpoint *tcp://host:port*
        What endpoint to connect to. Defaults to *tcp://127.0.0.1:2998*.

        Supports DNS resolution for both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints.

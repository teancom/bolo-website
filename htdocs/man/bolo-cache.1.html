    bolo cache - Bolo Caching Daemon

SYNOPSIS
    bolo cache [options] -e tcp://bolo:2997 -B tcp://127.0.0.1:2997

DESCRIPTION
    bolo is a lightweight monitoring system kernel that aggregates counter
    data and sample readings, maintains event and state information, and
    broadcasts its findings to all connected *bolo subscribers*. These
    subscribers can perform a wide variety of functions, from storing metric
    data in RRDs to sending notifications on state changes.

    bolo cache is a special bit of bolo infrastructure that subscribes to an
    upstream bolo(8) instance (the *endpoint*), and caches all seen metric
    and state PDUs while relaying them through to its own subscribers.
    Additionally, it binds a control port that allows clients to request a
    retransmission of all cached data, as if it were being freshly
    broadcast, preserving timestamps.

    This can be useful for stateless user tools that wish to have an
    up-to-date copy of all known states and metrics, without having to store
    that state in a data store.

OPTIONS
    -V, --version
        Print version and copyright information.

    -e, --endpoint *tcp://host:port*
        The bolo broadcast endpoint. Defaults to *tcp://127.0.0.1:2997*.
        Supports DNS resolution for both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints.

    -B, --broadcast *tcp://*:port*
        Where to re-broadcast from. Clients connecting to this port can
        expect the exact same protocol as the bolo(8) broadcast endpoint,
        with the potential for repeats and re-transmissions of older PDUs.

        Defaults to *tcp://127.0.0.1:2897*.

    -l, --listen *tcp://*:port*
        What address and port to bind on for the controller channel. Clients
        can connect to this (via a PUSH socket) and submit a REPEAT PDU to
        cause a re-broadcast of all known PDUs to all connected clients.

        Defaults to *tcp://127.0.0.1:2898*.

    -F, --foreground
        By default, bolo cache will fork into the background, detach its
        terminal and daemonize itself. This option inhibits that behavior,
        and also stops its from setting the effective UID / GID (see -u and
        -g).

    -p, --pidfile */path/to/pidfile*
        Specify where bolo cache should write its PID to, for control by
        init scripts. Defaults to /var/run/bolo/cache.pid. Has no effect if
        -F is given.

    -u, --user *USERNAME*
    -g, --group *GROUP NAME*
        User and group to drop privileges to. By default, bolo cache will
        run as root:root, which is probably not what you want.

    -v, --verbose
        Enable verbose mode, printing debugging information to standard
        error.

TRANSPARENT PROXY MODE
    If you run bolo(8) and bind its broadcast endpoint to something other
    than *tcp://*:2997* (say, for instance, *tcp://127.0.0.1:1234*), you can
    transparently front it with bolo cache broadcasting on *tcp://*:2997*
    and clients will never know the difference.

SEE ALSO
    bolo(7) for general information,

    bolo(1) and bolo.conf(5) for documentation on the CLI tools,

    dbolo(1), dbolo.conf(5) for details on the distributed bolo agent,

    and read about subscribers in bolo2rrd(8), bolo2pg(8), bolo2meta(8), and
    bolo2redis(8)

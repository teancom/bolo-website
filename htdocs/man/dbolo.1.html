    dbolo - Distributed Bolo Monitoring Agent

SYNOPSIS
    dbolo [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
    bolo is a lightweight monitoring system kernel that aggregates counter
    data and sample readings, maintains event and state information, and
    broadcasts its findings to all connected *bolo subscribers*. These
    subscribers can perform a wide variety of functions, from storing metric
    data in RRDs to sending notifications on state changes.

    dbolo is a standalone daemon that schedules and executes Bolo collectors
    and submits the results up to a central Bolo core endpoint.

OPTIONS
    -V, --version
        Print version and copyright information.

    -e, --endpoint *tcp://host:port*
        The bolo listener to connect to. Defaults to *tcp://bolo:2999*.
        Supports DNS resolution for both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints.

    -c, --commands */path/to/dbolo.conf*
        Path to a file containing the commands to run and their intervals.
        Defaults to */etc/dbolo.conf*. See dbolo.conf(5) and the section
        COMMANDS FILE, below, for details.

    -s, --splay *FACTOR*
        The initial run of each command will be randomized to start within
        *INTERVAL* * *FACTOR* seconds. This helps more evenly distribute the
        load on the local machine, without triggering freshness windows by
        delaying too long.

        Normally, you will want to specify a splay factor less than 1.0, to
        avoid scheduling anomalies when dbolo is restarted.

        See SCHEDULING CONCERNS, below, for more information.

    -v, --verbose
        Increase logging verbosity. In daemon mode, this bumps up the syslog
        logging level (i.e. from INFO to WARNING or from WARNING to ERR).

    -q, --quiet
        Suppress non-critical logging and output.

    -F, --foreground
        Normally, dbolo forks into the background and detaches from the
        controlling terminal, so that it can run as a system service. This
        flag disables that behavior. As a side effect, all log messages will
        be printed to the screen, bypassing syslog entirely.

    -p, --pidfile */path/to/pidfile*
        Specify where dbolo should write its PID to, for control by init
        scripts. Defaults to /var/run/dbolo. Has no effect if -F is given.

    -u, --user *USER*
    -g, --group *GROUP*
        User and group to drop privileges to. By default, dbolo will run as
        root:root, which is probably not what you want.

        Keep in mind that all commands executed by dbolo will be run by this
        user and group.

    -b, --beacon *tcp://host:port*
        To enable beaconing (heartbeats) specify the 0mq Beacon endpoint of
        the Core server.

        If no endpoint is specified, beaconing is disabled, by default.

    -r, --reconnects *INTERGER*
        The maximum allowable reconnects when heartbeating is enabled,
        otherwise normal opertion is suspended and the agent waits until a
        beacon is recieved, or is manually restarted.

        Defaults to 4.

    -t, --timeout *MILLISECONDS*

COMMANDS FILE
    dbolo derives most of its behavior from its command file. This file
    specifies what commands should be run, and how often.

    Here's an example:

        # /etc/dbolo.conf

        # run the `linux' collector every minute
        @60s /usr/lib/bolo/collectors/linux

        # run these every 15s
        @15s /usr/lib/bolo/collectors/process -n sshd
        @15s /usr/lib/bolo/collectors/process -n dbolo

        # run the log checks hourly
        @1h /usr/local/collectors/log_check /var/log/messages
        @1h /usr/local/collectors/log_check /var/log/syslog
        @1h /usr/local/collectors/log_check /var/log/secure

    Comments start with '#' and continue to the end of the line. Blank lines
    are ignored.

    Remaining lines specify how often to run a command (the
    @-specification), and the command to run. The following time units are
    recognized: h (hours), m (minutes) and s (seconds). Time must be
    specifed in whole numbers; i.e. a half hour is *@30m*, not *@0.5h*.
    Everything after the interval (excluding whitespace) is the full
    command, with arguments, up to the newline.

    Or, more rigorously:

        @[0-9]+[hms] <command>\n

    Line continuation is not possible; each command must be specified on
    exactly one line, with no newlines.

SCHEDULING CONCERNS
    The dbolo scheduler ensures that checks start properly, according to
    their configured interval, regardless of the execution time of a single
    run. If you configure a command to run every 60s, and it takes 5s to
    execute, there will only be a 55s delay between the end of one run and
    the start of another. This keeps metric submission more regular, and
    avoids the problem of scheduling drift.

    It is possible to schedule command runs too close together. For example,
    if a command takes 90s to timeout when some network endpoint it deals
    with is offline, running it every 60s would introduce an overlap
    condition. In this case, the scheduler behaves thusly:

        Time    Action
        ----    --------------------------------
        0s      dbolo executes command
                dbolo schedules next run at 0s (now) + 60s (interval) = 60s

        60s     <nothing happens, command is still running>

        90s     command exits
                dbolo processes results and submits them to bolo
                dbolo executes command (immediately)
                  (should have run at 60s)
                dbolo schedules next run at 90s (now) + 60s (interval) = 150s

        95s     network issue clears up
                command exits
                dbolo processes results and submits them to bolo

        150s    dbolo executes command

                etc.

    As you can see, at 0s, dbolo schedules the next run of the command to be
    in *interval* seconds, at 60s. However, since the command is still
    timing out (and hasn't exited yet), dbolo will delay execution until 90s
    when the command does exit. At that point, execution is late, so dbolo
    will immediately execute the command a second time, and reset the next
    run to be in *interval* seconds, which is now at 150s.

    The important thing to remember is that dbolo will wait until the
    command executes before consulting the schedule, and will not get so far
    behind that it cannot catch up. Imagine what happens to the schedule if
    the command keeps timing out for another 10 or 20 runs.

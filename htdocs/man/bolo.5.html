    bolo.conf - Bolo configuration file

SYNOPSIS
    /etc/bolo.conf

DESCRIPTION
    bolo(8) reads its configuration from */etc/bolo.conf* (unless a
    different file is specified via the -c option). This configuration file
    consists of *global declarations* that govern how bolo behaves, *type
    and window definitions*, and *state, sample and counter declarations*.

    Comments start with the '#' character and continue to the end of the
    line. Blank lines are ignored.

  Global Declarations
    The following configuration directives are recognized:

    listener tcp://*:2999
        What address and port to bind on, and listen for inbound data
        submission from monitored hosts. Note: if you wish to specify a
        single interface, you must specify it as an IP address.

    controller tcp://127.0.0.1:2998
        What address and port to bind on, and listen for inbound query and
        control requests from management hosts. The default bind on loopback
        (127.0.0.1) was chosen for security.

    broadcast tcp://*:2997
        What address and port to bind on, and broadcast data via.
        Subscribers will need to connect to this endpoint to do their jobs.
        As with listener and controller, specific interfaces can be bound,
        but must be specified by IP address.

    beacon tcp://*:2996
        What address and port to bind on, and broadcast heartbeat beacons.
        If beacon is not specified beaconing is disabled and will not send
        messages. As with listener and controller, specific interfaces can
        be bound, but must be specified by IP address.

    sweep seconds
        The time between sending BEACON messages to subscribed agents, in
        seconds.

        Defaults to 60 seconds

    log info daemon
        Controls how bolo logs, where it sends log messages, and what
        messages are allowed to be logged.

        The first token is the log level, one of debug, info, notice,
        warning, error, alert, critical, or emergency.

        The second token is the syslog facility to log to, one of daemon, or
        local0-local7.

    savefile /var/lib/bolo/save.db
        bolo will periodically save its state, counter, sample and event
        data to this file, to avoid data loss in the event of application or
        host outages.

    save.interval 15
        The amount of time in seconds between which bolo save it's state to
        disk.

    save.size 4
        The amount of memory in megabytes to allocate to the memory mapped
        save file.

    keysfile /var/lib/bolo/keys.db
        The keysfile is like the savefile, except that user-provided
        configuration data (via KEY statements through bolo-send(1)) will be
        written there.

    dumpfiles /var/tmp/mon.%s
        NOTE: this configuration directive is DEPRECATED, and will be
        ignored.

        When bolo-query(1) initiates a DUMP to get all of the state, event
        and metric data from bolo, that information is written to disk,
        using this pattern to generate randomized temporary files. The first
        `%s' will be replaced with a random value. Subsequent `%s' tokens
        are ignored.

    grace.period 15
        Governs how long bolo will wait, after a metric window closes,
        before broadcasting the final values out. This allows for delays in
        the network.

  Type Definitions
    Each `type' stanza defines a named state type, which supplies some
    configuration to each state tracked. State type names must always start
    with a colon (:), and can consist only of alphanumeric characters,
    hyphens (-) and underscores (_). Each type name must be unique.

    NOTE: No state types will be defined by default.

    Each type must define a freshness, the number of seconds bolo will wait
    for a new STATE result before it decides that the state is stale, and
    triggers a non-OK state synthetically.

    Each type must also indicate what state to trigger on staleness, via the
    critical, warning or unknown keywords. For example, to trigger a
    staleness warning with the message "no results from last poll" after 5
    minutes of nothing:

        type :local-check {
          freshness 300
          warning "no results from last poll"
        }

  Window Definitions
    When bolo receives metric data, it will attempt to buffer and aggregate
    that data, according to the defined window.

    For sampled data, datapoints are collected until the window rolls over,
    and then an aggregate (average, variance, etc.) for that window and
    those data points is broadcast.

    For counter data, the value of the counter will increment until the
    window rolls over.

    For rate data, the difference between the first value seen in the
    window, and the last value seen, will be divided over the window to come
    up with a rate of change.

    Each window has a name and a timeframe specified in seconds. All window
    names start with the at-sign (@), and may consist only of alphanumeric
    characters, hyphens (-) and underscores (_). Each window name must be
    unique.

    For example, to define two windows, one for hourly aggregation and
    another for minutely aggregation:

        window @minutely 60
        window @hourly   3600

  State Declarations
    bolo requires you to identify what states it should manage. This can be
    done either directly (one definition per state name) or indirectly (via
    a pattern match). Each definition must tie the state name to a state
    type (defined above)

    Here, we define a single :local-check state, named www-health:

        state :local-check www-health

    Often, however, you'll want to define a pattern, to match more than one
    state name, and save yourself the typing. Here, we instruct bolo to
    accept all CPU-related states:

        state :local-check m/cpu/

  Sample & Counter Declarations
    Like states, samples, rates and counters must be defined in order for
    bolo to properly aggregate them. This can also be done directly, or via
    pattern matching:

        sample @minutely a-single-sample
        sample @minutely m/:sar:/          # Matches host1:sar:df,
                                           #         host2:sar:cpu, etc

        counter @minutely m/transacts/
        counter @minutely m/^http-40\d$/   # Matches http-403 and http-404,
                                           # but not http-200 or  http-415.

        rate    @minutely m/:cpu:/

    You can also save some more typing with the `use' keyword, which elects
    a metric window to be the default, for sample and counter definitions
    that don't explicitly associate one:

        use @hourly
        counter hourly-counter1
        counter m/-hourly$/
        sample  hourly-transactions
        rate    m/-per-hour$/

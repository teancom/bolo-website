# License

Bolo is licensed under the [GNU General Public License (v3)][gpl3].  The
goal is to ensure that the software remains beneficial to the IT community
and people interested in building monitoring systems.  On top of that, Bolo
makes use of other GPL'd software, notably 0MQ.

# Contributions

As Open Source software, Bolo grows and improves by way of contributions
from multiple developers, some working for different companies, in different
industries and on different continents.  In order to respect the
copyright of individual contributors, and to ensure that we have the legal
right to distribute the whole software under the terms of the GPL, we
require that all contributors sign a Contributor License Agreement, or CLA.

The CLA grants us the right to distribute contributions to Bolo, lets you
maintain your copyrights and patent claims, and protects the end users of
Bolo as much as possible.  Basically, it's a legal implement (not unlike the
GPL itself) that ensures we can keep making Bolo available as F/OSS.

Everyone contributing _legally significant_ (i.e. not typo corrections,
whitespace changes, etc.) must have a signed CLA on file.  Those will be
kept on this page, in the **Signed CLAs** section, for public record.

The CLA comes in two flavors: Individual and Corporate.

Most people will want the [Individual Contributor License Agreement][icla]
(often abbreviated to just *ICLA*).  The [Software Grant And Coroprate
Contributor License Agreement][ccla], or *CCLA*, lets corporate entities
enter into an agreement that covers work done by named employees.

# Signing Process

It's simple.

1. Download a copy of either the [ICLA][icla] or the [CCLA][ccla]
2. Print it out
3. Fill it out (in ink)
4. Scan / photograph it <!-- blog about ways of doing this on Mac / Android?  -->
5. Email the PDF per the instructions in the agreement
6. Go write some code

You are of course free to start working on a pull request before signing the
CLA, but you will need to get us the paperwork before we can merge your
changes, no matter who splendiferous the code is.

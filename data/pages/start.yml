# Getting Started

To compile the software, use the standard incantation:

    $ ./bootstrap
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check           # optional, but recommended
    $ sudo make install

This will compile and install all of the bolo components in
standard systems places.  bolo requires libzmq3, pthreads, librrd,
libpcre3 and [libvigor][libvigor] to run.  It uses [ctap][ctap] to
run automated tests (which are, again, highly recommended).

A Minimal System
----------------

The core of every bolo deployment is the `bolo` daemon itself,
which requires a configuration file, usually **/etc/bolo.conf**.

    # /etc/bolo.conf
    #
    listener   tcp://*:2999
    controller tcp://127.0.0.1:2998
    broadcast  tcp://*:2997

    log info daemon
    savefile /var/lib/bolo/save.db
    keysfile /var/lib/bolo/keys.db

    dumpfiles /var/tmp/bolo.%s

    type :generic {
      freshness 60
      critical "no result from monitored thing"
    }
    state :generic m/./

    window @minutely 60
    use @minutely
    sample  m/./
    counter m/./
    rate    m/./

This is a **catch-all** configuration, that expects all submitted
metrics to be collected at at least a 1-minute resolution, and
aggregate at the per-minute mark.  Check **bolo.conf(5)** for
details and more advanced usage.

You'll have to create the bolo user (or adjust how you launch the
bolo daemon):

    $ sudo useradd -rUd /var/lib/bolo -s /sbin/nologin bolo
    $ sudo mkdir /var/lib/bolo
    $ sudo chown -R bolo:bolo /var/lib/bolo

With this in place, start up the bolo daemon:

    $ sudo bolo

By default, bolo starts up daemonized, and reads from
/etc/bolo.conf.

Submitting Data
---------------

The **send_bolo** utility can be used to submit metrics and state
data to bolo, via the _listener_ port (TCP/2999 in our case):

    $ send_bolo -e tcp://localhost:2999 -t sample life 42
    $ send_bolo -e tcp://localhost:2999 -t sample universe 42
    $ send_bolo -e tcp://localhost:2999 -t sample everything 42

At this point, you will probably want to go get
[bolo-collectors][collectors] installed to give you some real
metric collectors, for real things like memory usage, swap rates,
CPU time allocation, etc.  The output from these collectors can be
piped directly into **send_bolo**:

    $ /path/to/collector | send_bolo -e tcp://localhost:2999

With collectors installed, you can also run **dbolo**, the
distributed bolo agent.  Create the _/etc/dbolo.conf_
configuration file:

    # /etc/dbolo.conf
    @10s /usr/lib/bolo/collectors/linux
    @1h  /usr/lib/bolo/collectors/hostinfo

And then launch dbolo as a standalone daemon:

    $ sudo dbolo

Now you've got a small agent process running and submitting
Linux-y performance data every 10s, and host metadata every hour.

Using the Data
--------------

As the bolo daemon receives metrics and state data from monitored
hosts, it aggregates the data and regularly broadcasts these
summaries out to connected subscribers.  One such subscriber is
**bolo2rrd**, which listens for samples, counters and rate data
and creates / updates RRD files on disk.

    $ sudo mkdir /srv/rrd
    $ sudo bolo2rrd -r /srv/rrd -e tcp://localhost:2997

bolo2rrd daemonizes into the background.

The **stat_bolo** utility also has a _listen_ mode wherein it
connects to the broadcast port and prints out the data as it is
received.  This can be useful for subscriber prototyping in
languages like Perl or Ruby, without having to deal directly with
0MQ and the bolo message protocol.

    $ stat_bolo -e tcp://localhost:2997 -l | grep 'universe'

Writing subscribers isn't that difficult, and provides an
interesting way of customizing the behavior of your monitoring
system without needing to modify bolo itself.

Notes On Production Environments
--------------------------------

If you're into [BOSH][bosh] for your infrastructure, we have a
[bolo-boshrelease][boshrel] you can check out!

If you are operating inside of a more traditional server-centric
environment, running on either Debian / Ubuntu or CentOS, you can
take advantage of pre-built packages for bolo and it's
dependencies, hosted on [packagecloud][pkgcloud].

For Debian/Ubuntu:

    $ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/bolo/bolo/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
    $ sudo apt-get install bolo dbolo bolo-collectors

For CentOS:

    $ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/bolo/bolo/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
    $ sudo yum install bolo dbolo bolo-collectors

Next Steps
----------

Congratulations!  You have a bolo-based monitoring system up.

So where do you go from here?

You'll probably want to build a user-interface to display graphs
rendered from the RRD files, even if that's just to render the
images via cron and serve them up statically.

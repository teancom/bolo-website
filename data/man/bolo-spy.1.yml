NAME
    bolo spy - Bolo Monitoring System Savefile Utility

SYNOPSIS
    bolo spy /path/to/bolo.conf /path/to/savedb

DESCRIPTION
    bolo is a lightweight monitoring system kernel that aggregates counter
    data and sample readings, maintains event and state information, and
    broadcasts its findings to all connected *bolo subscribers*. These
    subscribers can perform a wide variety of functions, from storing metric
    data in RRDs to sending notifications on state changes.

    bolo spy is a small admin utility for dumping the contents of a bolo
    savedb.

    Here's an example dump:

        counter :: counter1 = 5
          window 60
          last seen 1459088992
    
        rate :: rate1 ( 1000 : 1347 )
          window 60
          first seen 1459088992 / last seen 1459088992
    
        sample :: res.df:/
          n=1 min=4.200000e+01 max=4.200000e+01 sum=4.200000e+01 \
            mean=4.200000e+01 var=0.000000e+00
          window 3600
          last seen 1459088992
    
        state :: test.state.0
          [0] OK - all good
          last seen 1459088992 / expires 1459089053
          freshness 60
    
        state :: test.state.1
          [2] CRITICAL - critically-ness
          last seen 1459088992 / expires 1459089053
          freshness 60

NAME
    bolo2meta - Bolo Meta Performance Subscriber

SYNOPSIS
    bolo2meta

    bolo2meta -e tcp://host:port -F

    bolo2meta -u nobody -g nogroup --pidfile /var/run/my.pid

DESCRIPTION
    bolo is a lightweight monitoring system kernel that aggregates counter
    data and sample readings, maintains event and state information, and
    broadcasts its findings to all connected *bolo subscribers*. These
    subscribers can perform a wide variety of functions, from storing metric
    data in RRDs to sending notifications on state changes.

    bolo2meta is a subscriber that listens to all data broadcast by bolo and
    reports in new metrics about the throughput of the subscriber subsystem.

OPTIONS
    -V, --version
        Print version and copyright information.

    -e, --endpoint *tcp://host:port*
        The bolo broadcast endpoint. Defaults to *tcp://127.0.0.1:2997*.
        Supports DNS resolution for both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints.

    -S, --submit *tcp://host:port*
        The bolo listener endpoint. Metrics collected by bolo2meta will be
        submitted here, for storage and aggregation. Defaults to
        *tcp://127.0.0.1:2999*. Supports DNS resolution for both IPv4 and
        IPv6 endpoints.

    -P, --prefix *PREFIX*
        A string that will be used to prefix all submitted metric names.
        Defaults to *$fqdn:sys:bolo*, where *$fqdn* is the fully-qualified
        domain name of the local host.

    -F, --foreground
        By default, bolo2meta will fork into the background, detach its
        terminal and daemonize itself. This option inhibits that behavior,
        and also stops its from setting the effective UID / GID (see -u and
        -g).

    -p, --pidfile */path/to/pidfile*
        Specify where bolo2meta should write its PID to, for control by init
        scripts. Defaults to /var/run/bolo2meta.pid. Has no effect if -F is
        given.

    -u, --user *USERNAME*
    -g, --group *GROUP NAME*
        User and group to drop privileges to. By default, bolo2meta will run
        as root:root, which is probably not what you want.

    -v, --verbose
        Enable verbose mode, printing debugging information to standard
        error.

COLLECTED METADATA
    The following metrics are tracked and submitted back to bolo:

    state
    bogon.state
    sample
    bogon.sample
    rate
    bogon.rate
    counter
    bogon.counter
    transition
    bogon.transition
    event
    bogon.event
    bogon.unknown

    Each tracks the number of broadcast PDUs seen as a COUNTER. This allows
    the bolo core to be configured however the administrator sees fit with
    respect to windows and intervals.

    The bogon.* metrics track how many malformed broadcast PDUs were seen,
    of each type. In this context, a malformed PDU is one with the correct
    PDU type (i.e. "STATE" or "SAMPLE") but the wrong number of data frames.

    The bogon.unknown metric tracks unknown PDU types.

    Ideally, all of the bogon.* metrics will always be zero. If not, the
    broadcasting bolo core is either experiencing network problems (highly
    unlikely, but possible) or is buggy.

    Each of these metrics is submitted to the core every 5 seconds, even if
    the value of the metric is 0.

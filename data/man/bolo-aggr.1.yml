NAME
    bolo aggr - Bolo Monitoring System Daemon

SYNOPSIS
    bolo aggr [options]

    bolo aggr -c /path/to/bolo.conf

    bolo aggr -F

DESCRIPTION
    bolo is a lightweight monitoring system kernel that aggregates counter
    data and sample readings, maintains event and state information, and
    broadcasts its findings to all connected *bolo subscribers*. These
    subscribers can perform a wide variety of functions, from storing metric
    data in RRDs to sending notifications on state changes.

OPTIONS
    -V, --version
        Print version and copyright information.

    -c, --config */path/to/bolo.conf*
        Specify the path to an alternate configuration file. If not given,
        the default configuration file (/etc/bolo.conf) is used instead.

    -F, --foreground
        Normally, bolo aggr forks into the background and detaches from the
        controlling terminal, so that it can run as a system service. This
        flag disables that behavior. As a side effect, all logging will be
        forced to go to standard output, regardless of what syslog facility
        is specified in the configuration file.

    -D, --dump-config
        After reading the configuration, format it and print to standard
        output, then exit. This can be used to verify configuration changes
        before restarting bolo aggr.

FILES
    /etc/bolo.conf
        Defaults configuration file that bolo aggr reads on start up. See
        bolo.conf(5) for details.

    /var/run/bolo.pid
        In daemon mode (the default, unless -F is given), bolo aggr will
        write its process ID to this file, so that other programs (like
        /etc/init.d/bolo) can determine if the bolo aggr process is alive,
        and send signals to it.

        This can be changed via bolo.conf(5).

    /var/lib/bolo/save.db
        bolo aggr will periodically write everything it knows about states,
        events, counters and samples to this file, so that the information
        persists across program restarts, daemon crashes and system reboots.

        This can be changed via bolo.conf(5).

NETWORK PRESENCE
    bolo aggr binds to to three separate endpoints when it starts up.

    The listener, which normally binds to *tcp://*:2999*, fields incoming
    requests submitting data. This port should be open to all monitored
    hosts and devices. bolo aggr cannot be queried via the listener
    endpoint.

    The broadcast endpoint (normally bound on *tcp://*:2998*), is where
    subscribers will connect when they wish to begin receiving broadcast
    data. This port should only be open to other parts of your monitoring
    system, since, by its nature, it will send out lots of potentially
    sensitive information.

    Finally, the controller endpoint (*tcp://127.0.0.1:2998*, by default),
    allows clients like bolo query(1) to query specific state and event
    information. Take great care when deciding what parts of your network
    can access this port, since it affords lots of control over the bolo
    kernel.

    All three of these endpoints can be changed via bolo.conf(5).

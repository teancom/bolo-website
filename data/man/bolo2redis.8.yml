NAME
    bolo2redis - Bolo Redis Subscriber

SYNOPSIS
    bolo2redis -e tcp://host:port -H redis.my.domain -P 6379

    bolo2redis -F

    bolo2redis -u nobody -g nogroup --pidfile /var/run/my.pid

DESCRIPTION
    bolo is a lightweight monitoring system kernel that aggregates counter
    data and sample readings, maintains event and state information, and
    broadcasts its findings to all connected *bolo subscribers*. These
    subscribers can perform a wide variety of functions, from storing metric
    data in RRDs to sending notifications on state changes.

    bolo2redis is a subscriber that lists for KEY data and forwards it onto
    a Redis key-value store.

OPTIONS
    -V, --version
        Print version and copyright information.

    -e, --endpoint *tcp://host:port*
        The bolo broadcast endpoint. Defaults to *tcp://127.0.0.1:2997*.
        Supports DNS resolution for both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints.

    -H, --host *redis.fq.dn*
        The hostname or IP address of the Redis server to submit key/value
        data to. Defaults to *127.0.0.1*.

    -P, --port *6379*
        The TCP port that Redis is listening on. Defaults to *6379*, the
        standard Redis port.

    -F, --foreground
        By default, bolo2redis will fork into the background, detach its
        terminal and daemonize itself. This option inhibits that behavior,
        and also stops its from setting the effective UID / GID (see -u and
        -g).

    -p, --pidfile */path/to/pidfile*
        Specify where bolo2redis should write its PID to, for control by
        init scripts. Defaults to /var/run/bolo2redis.pid. Has no effect if
        -F is given.

    -u, --user *USERNAME*
    -g, --group *GROUP NAME*
        User and group to drop privileges to. By default, bolo2redis will
        run as root:root, which is probably not what you want.

    -v, --verbose
        Enable verbose mode, printing debugging information to standard
        error.

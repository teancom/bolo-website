NAME
    dbolo.conf - Distributed Bolo Monitoring Agent commands file

SYNOPSIS
    /etc/dbolo.conf

DESCRIPTION
    dbolo(1) reads a list of commands and their execution intervals from
    */etc/dbolo.conf* (unless a different file is specified via the -c
    option).

    Comments start with the '#' character and continue to the end of the
    line. Blank lines are ignored.

    Each command / interval is specified on a line by itself, in the
    following form:

        @<time><unit> <command>

    Where <time> is a number (integers only, no fractions), <unit> is a unit
    of time (h for hours, m for minutes or s for seconds) and <command> is
    the full command to execute, including any arguments.

EXAMPLE
        # /etc/dbolo.conf

        # run the `linux' collector every minute
        @60s /usr/lib/bolo/collectors/linux

        # run these every 15s
        @15s /usr/lib/bolo/collectors/process -n sshd
        @15s /usr/lib/bolo/collectors/process -n dbolo

        # run the log checks hourly
        @1h /usr/local/collectors/log_check /var/log/messages
        @1h /usr/local/collectors/log_check /var/log/syslog
        @1h /usr/local/collectors/log_check /var/log/secure

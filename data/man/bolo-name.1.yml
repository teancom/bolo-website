NAME
    bolo name - Bolo Monitoring System Qualified Name Utility

SYNOPSIS
    bolo name check QUALIFIED NAME [...]

    bolo name dump QUALIFIED-NAME [...]

    bolo name fix QUALIFIED NAME [...]

    bolo name match NAME1 NAME2

DESCRIPTION
    bolo is a lightweight monitoring system kernel that aggregates counter
    data and sample readings, maintains event and state information, and
    broadcasts its findings to all connected *bolo subscribers*. These
    subscribers can perform a wide variety of functions, from storing metric
    data in RRDs to sending notifications on state changes.

    bolo query is a small utility that parses and analyzes TSDP Qualified
    Names (i.e. type=sys,host=example01,m=cpu). It provides sub-comands for
    checking name equivalence (including wildcard matching semantics),
    canonicalization (via fix), validation (check) and debugging.

    The following commands are understood:

    check NAME(S)
        Check the well-formedness of one or more qualified names. Evaluates
        all arguments, and exits non-zero if any of them are invalid.

    dump NAME(S)
        Prints debugging information from the *qname* parser, which can be
        useful to developers and system integrators wishing to understand
        qualified names on a deeper level, and chase down bugs in the
        implementation.

    fix NAME(S)
        Parses each qualified name, canonicalizes it (by re-ordering name
        components), and prints it to standard out. Invalid or malformed
        names will be skipped, and an error (for each) will be printed to
        standard error.

    match NAME1 NAME2
        Parses both qualified names and checks if "NAME1" is equivalent to
        "NAME2", taking into account wildcard matching semantics.

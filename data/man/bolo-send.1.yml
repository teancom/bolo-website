NAME
    bolo send - Bolo Monitoring System Client

SYNOPSIS
    bolo send -t state name (ok|warning|critical|unknown) message string

    bolo send -t counter name [increment-value]

    bolo send -t sample name value [value ...]

    bolo send -t key key1=value1 key2=value2 ...

    bolo send -t event name [extra description ...]

    ./script | bolo send -t stream

DESCRIPTION
    bolo is a lightweight monitoring system kernel that aggregates counter
    data and sample readings, maintains event and state information, and
    broadcasts its findings to all connected *bolo subscribers*. These
    subscribers can perform a wide variety of functions, from storing metric
    data in RRDs to sending notifications on state changes.

    bolo send is a client that connects to a bolo daemon and submits data.

OPTIONS
    -t, --type (state|counter|sample|key|event|stream)
        Changes the behavior of bolo send. For all but *stream*, bolo send
        will interpret the rest of its arguments as a single type of data to
        submit.

        For -t state, bolo send expects three arguments: a state name, a
        status code (one of *ok*, *warning*, *critical* or *unknown*), and a
        message. Any remaining arguments will be concatenated to the message
        argument, separated by spaces (much like /bin/echo).

            bolo send -t state cpu warning CPU is 96.3% used

        For -t counter, provide the name of the counter and optionally, the
        value to increment it by (which if not provided defaults to 1).

            bolo send -t counter logins

        For -t sample, the name and one or more values must be provided.
        Each value will be submitted. For example, to submit three network
        packet/second readings:

            bolo send -t sample packets-per-second  120.4  130.8  99.76

        For -t key, you should supply one or more arguments, of the format
        "key=value":

            bolo send -t key hostname=host01 fqdn=host01.example.com

        Finally, for -t event, all you need to provide is the event name;
        the remaining arguments will be treated as extra data for the event,
        separated by a single space.

            bolo send -t event user.login jhacker logged in from 10.0.0.233

        Stream mode (-t stream) allows the caller to submit multiple types
        of data within a single session, by reading specially-formatted
        lines on standard input.

        Known commands for stream mode are:

            STATE <timestamp> <name> (ok|warning|critical|unknown) <message>
            COUNTER <timestamp> <name> [<increment-value>]
            SAMPLE <timestamp> <name> <value1> [<value2> ...]
            KEY <key>=<value> ...
            EVENT <timestamp> <name> <extra data>

    -e, --endpoint *tcp://host:port*
        The bolo listener to connect to. Defaults to *tcp://127.0.0.1:2999*.
        Supports DNS resolution for both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints.
